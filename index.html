        <h3> Meteor Touches Down - Las Vegas</h3>
        <p> No casualties and business as usual in one of those cities that <em style="color:aqua">never sleep</em>. While a few city blocks were taken off of the map, and a small portion of the city has been sectioned off and quarentiened - local officials are telling everyone that there is absolutely nothing to worry about. In fact, there will be a new observed holiday. No one questions the legitimacy of these claims, and there have been no reporters or investigators who have gone missing due to <em style="color:aqua"> probing </em>, in fact the unusually high reports of missing persons have been dismissed as nothing more than an unusual trend. There is no cause for <em style="color:aqua"> panic!!!</em></p>
