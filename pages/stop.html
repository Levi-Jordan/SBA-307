    <h1> The Truth </h1>
    <p> A secondary webpage means that they can't hear us as well. The extraterrestial life forms only know how to access index.html pages and cannot percieve any css as of now. This is expected to change really soon however, as they harness our knowledge banks and continue to adapt to our technologies. I expect this to happen within the next few weeks and I will either be deleting this, or I may be gone- much like my fellow colleagues. As you know, this  media outlet was a team of many, with plenty of esteemed reporters and journalists, and now it is just me. There are no reports of their disappearances, but I know what happened. Their pursuit of knowledge was not in vain, as I can piece together the last of this puzzle.</p>
    <h3>It's all a LIE</h3>
    <img id="gnarp" src="../images/gnarp.jpg" alt="Proof of alien life">
    <p>We know what they want us to think- that life is ordinary, that freak accidents happen. Or even more likely, that we know the truth and we won't speak up or do anything. They are working together with the extraterrestials already, they believe that there is more power in this case. Humanity has shattered itself and on the climb to the top, it has reached something beyond far beyond itself. Sinister. Impure. Alien. </p>

    <p>We have seen visual evidence of these creatures' existence, with a prime example being depicted in the media above. There have been no survivors who have been able to tell the tale, all that remains is lost tape footage.</p>

    <p>In summary, we are all doomed and the world is likely over.</p>
